# SynthLang Proxy Documentation

Welcome to the SynthLang Proxy documentation! This comprehensive guide covers all aspects of SynthLang Proxy, from installation and configuration to advanced features and development.

## What is SynthLang Proxy?

SynthLang Proxy is an advanced, high-performance middleware solution that sits between your applications and Large Language Model (LLM) providers. It transforms any existing LLM app or Coder into an agentic, hyper-optimized, self-evolving system that's significantly cheaper to operate, without requiring any rebuilding of your existing applications.

Key benefits include:

- **Token Compression**: Reduce token usage by up to 75% with SynthLang's advanced compression techniques
- **Semantic Caching**: Intelligently cache and reuse responses for similar queries
- **Agent Framework**: Add agentic capabilities to any LLM application with tools and multi-step workflows
- **Keyword Detection**: Automatically trigger tools and actions based on user messages
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Fine-grained control over feature access
- **PII Masking**: Protect sensitive information before sending to LLMs and in logs
- **Compatible Interface**: Drop-in replacement for OpenAI API endpoints
