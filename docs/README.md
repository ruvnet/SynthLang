# SynthLang Prompt Generator & Tester

## Overview

SynthLang Prompt Generator & Tester is a specialized system designed to optimize and translate existing prompts into SynthLang format while providing comprehensive testing capabilities through OpenRouter integration. This system focuses on prompt optimization, cost reduction, and maintaining prompt effectiveness through systematic testing.

## Core Features

- **Prompt Translation Engine**: Convert standard prompts into SynthLang format
- **Token Optimization**: Automatic analysis and reduction of token usage
- **Cost Analysis**: Real-time cost comparison between original and optimized prompts
- **OpenRouter Integration**: Multi-model testing capabilities
- **Performance Metrics**: Detailed analysis of prompt effectiveness
- **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple prompts simultaneously
- **Version Control**: Track prompt evolution and optimizations

## Benefits
