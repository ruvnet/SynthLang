      title: "Token Density Formula",
      text: `The information density D(L) for a language L is defined as the ratio of total information content to token count. This fundamental metric guides our optimization efforts:`,
      example: `D(L) = I(L) / T(L)

Where:
I(L) = Total information content in bits
T(L) = Total number of tokens used

Example Analysis:
English Prompt (80 tokens, 640 bits):
D(English) = 640/80 = 8 bits/token

SynthLang (25 tokens, 640 bits):
D(SynthLang) = 640/25 = 25.6 bits/token

Efficiency Gain: 3.2x improvement in information density`

      title: "Latency Analysis",
      text: `Latency reduction follows a quadratic relationship with token count due to the attention mechanism's complexity in transformer architectures:`,
      example: `L ∝ n²

For n tokens:
English (n=150): L ∝ 22,500
SynthLang (n=60): L ∝ 3,600

Reduction: 84% lower computational complexity
Real-world impact: ~50-70ms faster response times
Memory usage: 60% reduction in attention matrix size`
